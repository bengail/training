| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Week 1  | Rest. **Heat ideal, like hot tub or sauna 20-30 min**. Light x-train or a hike is good on any rest day. I like full rest though, with some mobility work and core. | 6-12 miles easy plus 6 x 20 second hills fast. On easy running, think smooth, relaxed, and light on feet. Ideally Z1/Z2, but it’s ok for HR to get higher on ups. **Do easy runs by effort, and it’s ok to flow when it flows\!**  [On the hill strides](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/how-to-do-power-hill-strides-for-trail-runners/), do them anytime after halfway, easing into them to avoid a pulled muscle, but you can push as fast as you can go without using sprinting form. Jog down the hill for recovery. **If you have a treadmill, you can add 10-15 minutes on the uphill treadmill after any run at 10-15% grade for fatigue resistance\! That can be weight vest hiking as well.**  **Do the [Core Snack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_q-wrf_-x4) routine 1-2 times every day\!** | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 6 x 90 second hills mod/hard (think 5k effort) with run down recovery after each, 6 x 45 second hills faster (think 3k effort), 1-2 miles moderate (think marathon effort), 1-2 miles easy The hills will engage top-end power, the [moderate running after will help the body shuttle lactate at higher speed](https://www.patreon.com/posts/steady-running-116121120)s Optional easy double or x-train. Any double can be the uphill treadmill, or a hike with a weight vest. **Doubles are 25-45 min, with 30 min being a sweet spot, and they can be VERY easy.** If your race involves lots of hiking, **weight vest hiking** at 15-20% grade would be idea to work into the plan as you get closer to race dayl, working on muscular endurance. Light Strength (like [Mountain Legs](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/3-minute-mountain-legs/)). **Do the Mountain Legs right after you finish your run on strength days\!** You can do a different routine that works for you as well on days with Mountain legs (like [Ultra Legs](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/ultra-legs-a-strength-routine-for-ultrarunners/)), or add squats. | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 8 x 30 seconds fast/2 min easy. The x-train days are ideally bike, elliptical, uphill treadmill running or weight vest hiking, stairmill, or some combination of similar activities. Aim to keep easy in Z2, rather than extremely low effort. On fast pushes, do a bigger bike gear or higher elliptical resistance and push\! **You can sub in a very easy run for any x-train day if you are 100% healthy, or split the day into a double.** The usual Tuesday mileage ranges are ideal if running. | 4-10 miles very easy. Aerobic recovery day\! Only advanced athletes should go farther than 6 miles on Friday, since you want to be fully recovered for weekend Heat ideal. Heat can be hot tub, sauna, or similar\!  | 10-16 miles easy/mod, progressing to steady effort. On these easy/mod runs, it’s ok to let effort wander up. **Practice fueling with plenty of carbs and hydration\!** Some vert is good, but choose whatever route seems most fun to you Ideally do your long runs on terrain with some climbing and descending\! Vert is your friend, and vert is more important than mileage in most cases (even high volume athletes can prioritize shorter runs with vert). **Think quick feet on the downhills, using every downhill as an opportunity to work on that skill. Mountain Legs** | 6-14 miles easy plus 6 x 20 second hills fast or easy/mod x-train. Sunday is a flex day--you could even go for a long bike or ski or hike\! Or mix up a run and uphill treadmill\! Mountain legs \+ squats (on Sundays, add 2 x 10 reps of squats) \+ back extensions (2 x 20), engaging glutes. **You can also continue any strength program that works for you\!** |
| Week 2  | Rest. Heat ideal. Very advanced athletes could jog, but only if super high mileage 80+ mpw\! | 6-14 miles easy with 5 x 20 seconds fast/2 min easy. [On these flatter strides](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/why-and-how-to-run-strides-to-improve-speed-on-the-trails/), ease into them even more since injury risk is higher. The top end of the range is only for high mileage athletes. Most athletes will thrive in the middle of the range as a max, particularly the day before workouts when you want to feel fresh. | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 16 x 1 min fast/1 min easy (think 5k effort on fasts), 2-3 miles easy/mod to mod (think 50k), 1-2 miles easy. **After workouts is the most ideal time for 10-15 min post-run uphill treadmill.**  Speed workout classic\! Just building up speed stimulus Optional easy double or x-train  Mountain Legs | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 5 x (4 x 1 min fast/1 min easy) with 2 min easy between sets. We want to build some x-train power before it becomes mostly aerobic later. **If you’re doing uphill treadmill or jogging on this day, do not do any of the structured workouts--just keep it unstructured.** | 4-12 miles very easy Heat ideal. **You can add passive heat on other days as well. Passive heat is low stress, so add it freely, but not on double days** | 13-18 miles easy/mod (20 min mod/hard around 1-hour effort near the start of the run). On the tempo, think relaxed, with permission to push a bit more near the end\!  The tempo would be best on a net uphill to reduce impact forces. Mountain legs \+ squats \+ back extensions. Strength a day earlier when Tuesday workouts the following week\! But you can be flexible with timing | 6-14 miles very easy plus 6 x 30 second hills fast or easy/mod x-train. The stress of the first 2 weeks likely adding up a bit now\! Mountain Legs  |
| Week 3  | Rest. Heat ideal | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 2-3 x (4 x 2 min fast/1 min easy) with 2 min easy between sets (think 10k to 5k effort), 2 miles moderate (think marathon), 1-2 miles easy. Really big and hard session\! **For the big workouts, there is a range of sets so that lower volume athletes don’t overdo it.** Remember, the goal is not to go as hard or fast as you can, but to run smoothly and finish feeling strong\! Always err on the side of less intensity, since health and the daily aerobic work is most important for long-term growth. Optional easy double or x-train  Mountain Legs | 6-14 miles easy plus 6 x 20 second hills fast. Keep these miles very easy post-workout | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 3-4 x 3/2/1 min fast with 1 min easy between intervals and 3 min easy between sets The final tougher x-train workout for a bit as the body adapts\! Mountain Legs | 4-12 miles very easy Heat ideal | 16-20 miles easy with 1 mile harder near the end. Pure aerobic day, with the faster mile being a fatigue resistance stimulus. **Fuel these long runs like the race to work on fatigue resistance.** Generally, aim for 75+ grams of carbs per hour on long runs Mountain Legs | 8-14 miles easy or easy/mod x-train. **Sunday x-train days could always be long adventures or hikes\!**  Mountain legs \+ squats \+ back extensions |
| Week 4  | Rest. Heat ideal | 8-14 miles easy with 5 x 30 seconds fast/2 min easy. Ease into the strides, thinking smooth and strong\! | Uphill treadmill at 8-10% ideal, though this workout can also be done outside, just cut the total intervals in half given downhill running\! 15-20 min easy warm-up, 12-15 x 3 min around 1-hour effort with 90 seconds easy recovery after each, 15-20 min easy cooldown. Uphill treadmill threshold workouts allow for very big sessions with little impact or risk, and will be key to this plan. **If doing these hill workouts outside, err on the side of more relaxed\!**  Optional easy double or x-train  Mountain Legs | 1-2 hours easy x-train. Make sure this is quality Z2 if you’re doing a non-impact activity like cycling. **Now would be a great time to work on more weight vest uphill hiking if you’re doing races with lots of hiking\!** Mountain Legs | 6-14 miles very easy plus 5 x 20 second hills Heat ideal | 12-18 miles easy/mod with 20 min mod/hard around 1-hour effort, finishing harder (do the tempo near the start of the run after the warm-up), plus 5 min harder near the end. This run will tax glycogen reserves, so fuel with major focus\! The tempo after the warm-up makes the distance of the run play longer.
