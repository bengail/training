| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Week 1  | Rest. On rest days, you can be active, but no pounding on your legs. Light heat training like sauna/hot tub ideal. | 3-8 miles easy plus 4-6 x 20 second hills fast. On the easy running, think relaxed and light on feet. On the hill strides, ease into the first few seconds and then think POWER on a 6-10% grade ideally Aim to do the [Core Snack](https://www.patreon.com/posts/109257823) routine 2 x per day most days for a quick core strength reinforcement\! Lower-volume athletes could add cross training on shorter run days like today\! | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 6-10 x 1 minute hills fast (think 5k to 3k effort) with run down recovery after each, 2-3 miles easy cool-down. A bit less steep on this one, more like 4-6%\! As hills get over 30 seconds, think about relaxed form and generating power from your glutes. You can do any workout on the treadmill as well\! Optional uphill treadmill double or easy x-train. Uphill treadmill is 10-15% grade for 20-30 min. X-train can be any duration\! Start strength work\! Do your own routine, or begin with just the mountain legs routine plus a couple exercises: \-10-20 rear lunges \-30-50 single leg step-ups \-20 x back extensions (engaging glutes) \-2 x 10 squats (start light) | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 6-10 x 30 seconds fast/2 min easy. On x-train days, we want to off-load from impact. Bike, elliptical, swim, etc (or a mix of activities) are all great. Ideally aim for Z2 rather than pure Z1 (in a 5-zone model). The 30-second efforts are to work on some specific muscular strength. | 3-6 miles easy. Fridays can be VERY easy, always going into weekend fully recovered | 6-12 miles easy/mod over hills. On easy/mod, it’s not a specific effort, but leeway to run on feel and have fun. The goal is to choose exciting routes and make this a run with intention and purpose\! Full strength routine. Can increase weight on squats\! We never want to get super sore from strength work, so even though this is a “power” plan, just do the mountain legs routine of lunges and step ups if you’re getting sore. We want to focus the effort on the specific power of the running and x-train\! | 60-90 minute easy to easy/mod uphill treadmill at 10-15% grade or 1-2 hours x-train. Sundays are flex days where we want to partially offload the body from impact\!  If you’re cross training, you can go longer (even very long days), and consider adding in 4-6 x 30 seconds fast for a power boost. Or you can do both activities if you have time and energy\! |
| Week 2  | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 3-4 x 2 min hills (think 5k), 3-4 x 1 min hills (think 3k), 3-4 x 30 second hills (push), 1-2 miles easy/mod on tired legs, 1-2 miles slow. Think 6-10% grade on the hills\! The steady running on tired legs can be as easy as 50k effort, just starting to practice lactate shuttling and efficient running on tired legs. Optional uphill TM double or easy x-train Just the mountain legs part of strength routine (rear lunges \+ single leg step ups) | 3-8 miles very easy. You can do this on the uphill treadmill if you’re beat up at all, or sub-in a cross training day | 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train with 3-4 x (4 x 1 min fast/1 min easy) with 2 min easy between sets. Think VO2 effort, or something you could sustain for 10-15 minutes Mountain legs routine only | 3-6 miles very easy recovery | 8-14 miles easy over hills plus 5 x 40 second hills at the end at 3k effort. The hills at the end are a fatigue resistance stimulus, maximizing muscle fiber recruitment. The steeper the grade, the better\! | 1-2 hours easy to easy/mod uphill TM at 10-15% grade or 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train Full strength routine |
| Week 3  |  | 4-10 miles easy plus 6 x 30 second hills. These will start to burn a bit and that’s ok\! | 2-3 miles easy, 4-5 x 3 minute hills mod/hard (think 5k effort, pushing as you go), 2 miles easy/mod on tired legs, 1-2 miles slow. Optional uphill TM double or easy x-train Full strength routine | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 10 x 20 seconds fast/2 min easy. Want to continue working on that muscular power in x-train\! | 3-6 miles very easy | 8-14 miles easy/mod with 20 min mod/hard around 1-hour effort on net uphill after the warm-up. The tempo will make the long run play longer and start to bring some of the hill adaptations together\! | 1-2 hours easy to easy/mod uphill TM at 10-15% grade or 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train Full strength routine |
| Week 4  |  | 4-10 miles easy. Lower intensity week with a bigger threshold workout and long run\! | 75-105 minute uphill treadmill at 10-15% grade with 5-8 x 5 minutes at 1-hour effort with 2 minutes easy recovery after each. This will help make the power you’re building translate into better endurance If you don’t have access to a treadmill, you can do 4-6 x 5 minutes outdoors, just do it on a soft surface\! Mountain legs only (step ups plus rear lunges) | 1-2 hours easy x-train. Ideally just a nice Z2 day | 3-6 miles very easy plus 4 x 20 second hills | 10-16 miles easy over hills. The goal on this one is to end feeling GOOD. Work on fueling and hydration especially\! | 1-2 hours easy to easy/mod uphill TM at 10-15% grade or 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train Mountain legs only |
| Week 5  |  | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 2-3 x 3/2/1 minute hills mod/hard with run down recovery after each (think 10k/5k/3k effort on each set), 10-15 minutes around 1-hour effort, 1-2 miles very easy cool-down This is a very hard session combining hills and threshold\! Full strength routine | 4-10 miles very easy. Pure recovery after the workout\! | 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train with 4-6 x 90/60/30 seconds fast with 1 min easy between intervals and 2 min easy between sets (think 30-min effort/VO2 effort/hard effort on each set) | 3-6 miles easy | 10-16 miles easy/mod over hills plus 4 x 1 min hills at the end around 3k effort. Fatigue resistance stimulus\! | 1-2 hours easy to easy/mod uphill TM at 10-15% grade or 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train Full strength routine |
| Week 6  |  | 4-10 miles easy plus 4 x 20 second hills | 2-3 miles easy, 3-5 x 1 mile fast (think 10k effort to start, pushing harder as you go) with 3 min easy recovery after each (think 10k effort to start, pushing a bit as you go), 4 x 30 second hills fast (push), 2-3 miles easy cool-down The goal is to bring everything together with a bigger session that isn’t uphill to have the better power mean better running economy Optional uphill TM double or easy x-train Mountain legs only | 1-2 hours easy x-train. Ideally a nice Z2 day | 3-6 miles very easy | 10-16 miles easy/mod (in a perfect world, you can do some sort of hard effort on this day, including something like a trail half marathon). You should notice a big improvement in running economy that prepares you to restart this type of plan, or move into another plan with higher volume\! | 1-2 hours easy to easy/mod uphill TM at 10-15% grade or 1-2 hours easy x-train Full strength routine |
