  
**SWAP 10-Week Winter Plan**  
**Note: the distance ranges are designed to create multiple plans in one**  
**Low end of the range: intermediate; High end: advanced athletes with big base**

| Special Rules for the Winter Plan |
| ----- |
| The final goals of the plan are to end the winter with major efficiency in Z2 (improving velocity at aerobic threshold) and top-end mechanical power Each week involves options for indoor training and ski, and you can be flexible around what brings you joy Given the uncertainty of weather, it’s important to move around days based on what fits best with the conditions (and your life constraints). Prioritize the workout and the long run, moving them whenever needed The track workouts are optional--you can do them on roads or even the treadmill\!  |

| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Week 1 | Rest. Heat ideal like sauna or hot tub. You can be active with light bike or hike, but full rest is great\! | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 6-10 x 30 second slight hills fast with jog back recovery, 1-2 miles moderate, 1-2 miles easy On the easy running, think light on feet and relaxed. Easy runs can be a big mix of paces--on days you feel good it can be a bit faster, and on days you feel tired, it can be very slow. On the hills, find a gradual grade 3-5% and run up quick, thinking 3k to mile effort. By the end of the workout, it should feel like the muscles are fatigued but you could keep doing more.  On the moderate running, aim for moderate and relaxed effort, around 50k effort for advanced athletes. This works on lactate shuttling after the hills | 60-90 min uphill treadmill in Zone 2 Z2 uphill treadmill is about finding a sustainable high-aerobic effort without much impact on the body. Aim for 10-15% grade, and whatever pace corresponds to the correct effort. It’s ok for effort to drift into Z3 as you go. [Here is a tutorial](https://www.patreon.com/posts/z2-uphill-theory-129560209). Practice fueling and hydration on these sessions\! | 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train or ski day\! On the x-train days, it can be bike, elliptical, stairmaster, or a mix of similar activities. In a perfect world, you use winter to improve at biking, since that provides more long-term room for growth. Easy/mod x-train just means to ride freely--you can include shorter moderate sections, virtual bike climbs, and generally just have some fun indoors. You can also use Thursdays for ski/winter sports, and those days can be longer\! | 6-12 miles very easy Friday runs can be so relaxed, just aiming to get to the weekend feeling good\!  | 10-16 miles easy with 5 x 45 second hills fast (think 3k effort) near the end. On the long run, think smooth and fun, rather than pushing. Generally that will mean Z2, but the effort can vary based on terrain and the day, and even be higher quality when you feel good. On the fatigue resistance hills, the goal is to activate nervous system pathways for high output at the end of the long run. A 4-6% grade is ideal, easing into the effort to avoid straining a muscle. Practice fueling and hydration on every long run\! | 8-14 miles easy or 1-2+ hours easy x-train/uphill TM Sunday is an adventure flex day\! If you like winter sports, it’s a great time to go play on the snow for as long as you want. If you want to stay indoors, bike or uphill treadmill. Or you can go outside and add up some easy miles\! |
| Week 2 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 2-3 miles easy warm-up with a couple light strides, 2-3 x (4 x 400 fast) with 90 seconds easy jog between intervals and 3 min easy between sets, 1-2 miles steady, 1-3 miles easy On the 400s, think 5k effort or so, practicing smooth speed. You can do this session on the track or on roads if you’d prefer to avoid the track. | 60-105 min uphill treadmill in Z2 | 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train or ski day You can have fun and push these sessions a bit, even doing something like a Zwift race if that sounds fun. Keep it playful\! | 6-12 miles very easy plus 6 x 20 second slight hills. The hills are ideal for building speed and power\! | 10-16 miles steady.  Start easy and work into it, settling into a smooth flow. The exact effort can vary, but generally high Z2/low Z3 style effort (in 5-zone model\!). Generally, you want it to feel purposeful but not hard\! | 8-14 miles easy or 1-2+ hours easy x-train/uphill TM. If you’re x-training or on the snow, you can go longer on these days if that sounds fun\!  |
| Week 3 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 8-12 x 40 second hills fast (think 3k effort), 2-4 miles easy cool-down Same type of workout as in week 1, just building up the duration a bit (and without the steady running given the workout tomorrow). The final 10 seconds of these intervals will be spicy at the end. Practice relaxing in your form as things get more challenging. | 75-105 min uphill treadmill with 8-12 x 3 minutes around 1-hour effort with light progression with 1 min easy recovery These types of bigger uphill threshold workouts are wonderful for winter training, allowing athletes to build aerobic fitness without much impact. The ideal grade for the intervals is 8%, keeping the recoveries at 8% but just slowing them down a lot. You can also do these workouts at lower grades (even flat) if that brings you the most joy\! | 1-2 hours easy x-train or ski day Keep this day very easy on the body, more Z1 than other weeks. | 6-12 miles very easy Another pure recovery day before going a bit longer on Saturday\! | 12-20 miles easy with 5 x 45 second hills near the end around 3k effort You should notice some comfort with the fatigue resistance after the workout in the first week\! Have fun with these long runs and move them around for the best weather windows. Really emphasize fueling and hydration\!  | 8-14 miles easy plus 5 x 20 second slight hills fast or 1-2+ hours easy x-train/uphill TM with 5 x 30 seconds harder near the end Some light strides at the end of this one to go into next week feeling strong\!  |
| Week 4 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 6-12 miles very easy | 8-13 miles steady, with nice smooth flow. A big goal of this plan is to improve Z2 paces, and this type of aerobic week will be a great time to practice\! | 1-2 hours easy x-train or ski day | 6-12 miles very easy | 10-16 miles steady flow | 6-12 miles easy plus 5 x 30 second hills or 1-2+ hours x-train/uphill TM with 5 x 30 seconds harder near the end |
| Week 5 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 2-3 miles easy warm-up with a couple light strides, 6-10 x 500 fast with 300 easy recovery (think 5k effort), 4 x 200 fast with 200 slow recovery (push these a bit), 2-3 miles easy cool-down Really relax in the first 300 of each interval, making sure you aren’t going too hard. On the 200s, let yourself open up in the final 200 to work on top-end sustainable speed\! | 75-105 min uphill TM in Z2 | 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train or ski day You can have fun with some light pushes on this one if feeling good, but nothing too hard\! | 6-12 miles very easy plus 5 x 20 second slight hills fast | 10-18 miles easy. Nice and relaxed on this one, really dialing back the intensity\! | 8-14 miles easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM |
| Week 6 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 8-12 miles steady, thinking smooth and relaxed\!  Fuel this one really well\! | 75-105 min uphill treadmill with 5-8 x 5 minutes around 1-hour effort with 2 minutes easy recovery. A bigger threshold session here--you should start feeling more comfortable with lactate shuttling\! | 1-2 hours easy x-train or ski day Think Z1 on this one, nice and relaxed\! | 6-12 miles very easy | 10-16 miles steady.  You should feel much better with sustained (yet relaxed) efforts | 8-14 miles easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM |
| Week 7 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 8-12 x 45 second hills fast (think 3k) with jog down recovery, 1-3 miles steady, 1-2 miles easy | 75-120 min uphill TM in Z2 2 hour uphill sessions are really big and require major fueling and hydration\! | 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train or ski day | 6-12 miles very easy  | 12-20 miles easy with 6 x 1 min hills near the end around 5k effort, pushing a bit as you go | 8-14 miles easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM |
| Week 8 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 6-12 miles very easy | 10-14 miles steady | 1-2 hours easy x-train or ski day | 6-12 miles very easy | 12-18 miles steady flow | 8-14 miles easy plus 5 x 30 second hills or 1-2+ hours x-train/uphill TM with 5 x 30 seconds harder near the end |
| Week 9 | Rest. Heat ideal\! | 2-3 miles easy warm-up with a couple strides, 3-5 x 600/400/200 fast with 200 recovery after intervals and 400 recovery between sets, 4 x 200 fast with 200 slow recovery (pushing a bit), 2-3 miles easy cool-down | 75-120 min uphill TM in Z2 | 1-2 hours easy/mod x-train or ski day | 6-12 miles very easy plus 5 x 20 second slight hills fast | 10-18 miles easy. Nice and relaxed, emphasizing feeling good at the end\! | 8-14 miles easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM |
