| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Week 1  | rest | 4-12 miles easy on flatter terrain  with 5 x 20 seconds fast/2 min easy. On easy running, think smooth, with quick strides, and no tension in the body. On days you feel great, [easy runs](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/the-science-and-art-of-pacing-easy-runs) can be quicker as long as it feels easy and doesn’t impact recovery. On [flat strides](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/why-and-how-to-run-strides-to-improve-speed-on-the-trails/), think smooth and strong, like 800m/mile effort rather than a sprint, which should get faster over the course of the cycle. Ease into them to avoid pulling a muscle. On [hill strides](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/how-to-do-power-hill-strides-for-trail-runners), find a moderate grade around 6-8% and run up as fast as you can go without sprinting, jogging down and around for 1-2 min before the next one  | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 4 x (4 x 1 min fast/1 min easy) with 2 min easy between sets (think 5k effort, with light progression as you go), 2-3 miles easy. First speed stimulus, brain and body will take some time to get used to it, but you’ll adapt fast\! Supershoes ideal for mid-week speed workouts\!  Optional easy run double or x-train double, 20-35 min. Doubles are purely optional and aerobic unless otherwise noted. You can do these on the uphill treadmill as well. Only do these if feeling great and time to spare\! | 4-12 miles easy on or 1-2 hours easy/mod x-training. Nothing is too slow for easy runs\! Optional run double or x-train double.  On x-train days, we want aerobic strain without impact. [Elliptical](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/elliptical-cross-training/) or bike are ideal, but you can also do uphill hiking. | 3-10 miles easy on flatter terrain or rest. The day before the weekly long run, take it extra chill\! You can even [shuffle](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/the-art-of-the-easy-shuffle) at your slowest paces if tired. X-train totally good on this day instead\! | 8-16 miles easy/mod (at 20 minutes and every 5 minutes after, do 1 min around 1-hour effort). On [easy/mod long runs](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/increasing-endurance-with-easy-moderate-long-runs), you can go on feel, letting your body dictate effort, with the option to push a bit more when feeling good. This fartlek should feel light and fun\! Long runs can be on trails as well, even during 5k/10k training\! On all Saturdays with runs under 14 miles, advanced athletes could add cross training. | 4-13 miles easy on flatter terrain plus 6 x 20 second steep hills fast and/or x-train longer.
