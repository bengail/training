| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Week 1  | Rest. Heat ideal like sauna or hot tub. You can be active with light bike or hike, but full rest is great\! | 6-12 mi easy plus 5 x 20 second hills. On the easy running, think smooth and relaxed\! The goal is to be fresh for the workout on Wednesday and have fun doing it. You can do runs on any terrain you like, but ideally keep some hills on all of your easy running. On the hill strides, ease into them to avoid pulling a muscle, building up toward 800/mile effort\!  | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 6-10 x 2 min fast/90 seconds easy (think 5k effort), 2-3 miles easy cool-down.  On warm-up and cool-down, don’t run intentionally slowly, but think light on feet and relaxed (every easy mile is an opportunity to work on form). For the 2 min intervals, relax your hips, think about slight forward lean, and letting your glutes do as much of the work as possible (relaxing quads). This will be hard by the end, preparing the body for quick adaptation in this short build Optional easy double or uphill TM. All easy doubles can be very slow and chill, or even cross training. Anywhere from 20-30 minutes (very advanced athletes could do up to 45 minutes). The goal is to get added aerobic stimulus with low recovery cost | 6-12 mi easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM. Thursday is an aerobic flex day, aiming to get a good aerobic stimulus but relatively agnostic on activity. You can bike longer, or uphill treadmill in Z2 up to 90-120 min for advanced athletes, or just go on a nice jog. Keep post-workout days very easy to absorb the stimulus\! Optional easy double or uphill TM | 4-10 mi easy plus 4 x 30 second hills or rest/x-train Keep this run very easy going into the long run, with the goal of feeling 100% on Sat.  30 second hills are much tougher than 20 seconds, embrace that space\!  Rest/x-train options for lower volume or busy athletes\! | 8-16 miles easy/mod (3-5 x 1 mile at 1-hour effort with 3 min easy recovery after each). On easy/mod, think purposeful steady running, rather than a specific effort. Usually that means high Z2 with some Z3 on uphills, but let it come to you when cueing into being light on feet and relaxed. On the miles, err on the side of easier at first, with the bigger threshold session giving you some initial feel for this effort. Do weekend runs on course-specific terrain ideally, erring on the side of more hills. Fuel with high carb and good hydration on this one\! | 6-12 mi easy or longer x-train. Sundays can be longer adventure days too, where you turn off the watch and go explore\! Very advanced athletes can add an optional easy double or uphill TM |
| Week 2  | Rest. Heat ideal | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 6-10 x 1 min fast/90 seconds easy (think 3k effort), 3 min easy, 1-2 x 10 min at threshold effort (1-hour effort), 2-3 miles easy cooldown. On the 1 min fast intervals, think knee drive, letting yourself push a bit as you go, keeping the recoveries very easy. On the threshold, you’ll feel way more tired and slow than expected--be patient with your body and brain, going by effort rather than pace Optional easy double or uphill TM | 6-12 mi easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM A nice aerobic day between workouts\! Optional easy double or x-train | Uphill TM workout\! 75-105 min at 8% grade with 4-8 x 5 min at 1-hour effort with 2 min easy recovery after each. On the uphill treadmill, the goal is to off-load the body from impact while getting a big aerobic stimulus Start with a 15-20 minute warm-up and a couple strides to get used to paces, with the threshold intervals starting on the easy side and working into them. The first couple intervals should be relaxed, and the session will get more difficult as you build volume. | 4-10 mi very easy or rest/x-train. Keep this day incredibly relaxed\! The slower the better | 10-20 miles easy/mod long run.  This long run is a relaxed aerobic day, mostly Z2 with big fueling, aiming to finish feeling good. | 6-12 mi easy plus 4 x 30 second hills or longer x-train |
| Week 3  | Rest. Heat ideal | 6-12 mi easy with 5 x 20 seconds fast/2 min easy. On these flat strides, build up speed gently and think about staying relaxed at fast paces (800 meter-style effort) | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 6-12 x 3 min around 1-hour effort with light progression, with 1 minute easy recovery after 2, 90 seconds after 2, and 2 minutes after the remainder, 5 minutes easy, 4 x 30 second hills fast, 2-3 miles easy cooldown. Now we are getting into higher volume outdoor workouts\! Ease in and be patient with your body The hills at the end build neuromuscular power and muscle fiber recruitment under fatigue Fuel these big sessions very well\! Optional easy double or uphill TM | 6-12 mi easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train. These can always be uphill TM too\! | 4-10 mi easy plus 4 x 30 second hills or rest/x-train | 10-20 miles easy/mod long run (after the warm-up, do 20 minutes around 1-hour effort). Do the tempo after a few mile warm-up, ideally on fun terrain that excites you (which can be anything from small loops to a slight net downhill to a climb). That will make the long run play longer as well\! | 6-12 mi easy or longer x-train. Aerobic flex day\! Sundays all about some adventure |
| Week 4  | Rest. Heat ideal | 2-3 miles easy, 4-8 x 90 second hills fast (think 5k effort) with run down recovery after each, 5 min easy, 2-4 x 5 min around 1-hour effort with 2 min easy recovery after each, 2-3 miles easy. On the hills, find a grade where you can run strong, ideally 6-8% average, thinking power in your stride. On the threshold intervals, embrace that space of being slower than the effort feels like it should be\! Optional easy double or uphill TM | 6-12 mi easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM. Keep it very chill between efforts\! Fuel this work well to be maximally recovered for Thursday too. Optional easy double or uphill TM | 75-105 min at 8% grade with 3-6 x 8 min at 1-hour effort with 2 min easy recovery after each. Really ease into these, because 8 min intervals become very difficult off a 1:4 rest:interval ratio\! | 4-10 mi very easy or rest/x-train | 10-20 miles easy. Nice and relaxed on this one, thinking light on feet with big fueling. Hopefully you’ll start to see some aerobic progress that makes the paces flow easier here. | 6-12 mi easy plus 4 x 30 second hills or longer x-train |
| Week 5  | Rest. Heat ideal | 6-12 mi easy plus 5 x 20 second hills | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 10/8/6/4/2 min around 1-hour effort with 2 min easy recovery after each, 5 min easy, 4 x 30 second hills fast, 2-3 miles easy cooldown (less advanced or lower volume athletes start at the 8-min interval) Going down the ladder, you can push a bit more if you’re feeling good\! Optional easy double or uphill TM | 6-12 mi easy or 1-2 hours easy x-train/uphill TM Optional easy double or uphill TM | 4-10 mi easy plus 4 x 30 second hills or rest/x-train | 10-16 miles easy/mod with 2-3 x 2 miles around 1-hour effort with 4 min easy recovery after each. At the end of this run, add 5 x 45 second hills at 3k effort for a fatigue resistance stimulus.  Think about maintaining quick cadence as you fatigue on this one\!   | 6-12 mi easy or longer x-train |
| Week 6  | Rest. Heat ideal | 6-12 mi easy plus 4 x 20 second hills | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 3-4 x 4 min around 1-hour effort with light progression, with 1 min very easy recovery after each, 5 min easy, 4 x 45 second slight uphills fast (think 3k) with jog back recovery, 2-3 miles easy cooldown A nice tune-up before the weekend, solidifying gains from the training block. Optional easy double or uphill TM | 6-10 mi easy or 60-90 min easy x-train/uphill TM No optional double to dial back  | 4-8 mi easy plus 4 x 30 second hills or rest/x-train. Rest this day if feeling tired at all\! | 3-6 mi easy with 4 x 20 seconds fast/40 seconds easy, plus 1 min at half M effort Nice and relaxed on the 20/40s, just getting moving. The 1 minute at threshold helps you find the feel\! | HALF MARATHON or evaluation workout where you do 4-6 x 1 mile intervals with 3 min recovery after each like on the first week of the plan, seeing how your body has responded to the training block |
