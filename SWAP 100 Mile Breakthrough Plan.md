| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Week 1  | Rest. Heat ideal. Light x-train or a hike is good on any rest day. I like full rest though\! | 6-12 miles easy plus 6 x 30 second hills fast. On easy running, think smooth, relaxed, and light on feet. Ideally Z1/Z2, but it’s ok for HR to get higher on ups. [On the hill strides](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/how-to-do-power-hill-strides-for-trail-runners/), do them anytime after halfway, easing into them to avoid a pulled muscle, but you can push as fast as you can go without using sprinting form. Jog down the hill for recovery. **If you have a treadmill, you can add 10-15 minutes on the uphill treadmill after any run**   **Do the [Core Snack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_q-wrf_-x4) routine 1-2 times every day\!** | 2-3 miles easy warm-up, 6 x 90 second hills mod/hard (think 5k effort) with run down recovery after each, 6 x 45 second hills faster (think 3k effort), 2 miles moderate (think marathon effort), 1-2 miles easy The hills will engage top-end power, the moderate running after will help the body shuttle lactate at higher speeds Optional easy double or x-train (with optional heat suit too). Any double can be the uphill treadmill\! Heat suit just means a heavy jacket and pants to raise core temperature--only do if very advanced (or for very hot race) Light Strength (like [Mountain Legs](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/3-minute-mountain-legs/)) | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 8 x 30 seconds fast/2 min easy. The x-train days are ideally bike, elliptical, uphill treadmill running, stairmill, or some combination of similar activities. Aim to keep easy in Z2, rather than pure low effort. On fast, do bigger gear and push\! You can sub in a very easy run for any x-train day, or split the day into a double | 4-10 miles very easy. Aerobic recovery day\! Only advanced athletes should go farther on Friday, since you want to be fully recovered for weekend Heat ideal. Heat can be hot tub, sauna, or similar\! | 10-16 miles easy/mod, progressing to steady effort. On these easy/mod runs, it’s ok to let effort wander up. Practice fueling with plenty of carbs and hydration\! Some vert is good, but choose whatever route seems most fun to you | 6-14 miles easy plus 6 x 20 second hills fast or easy/mod x-train. Sunday is a flex day--you could even go for a long bike or ski or hike\! Or mix up a run and uphill treadmill\! Strength \+ squats (on Sundays, add 2 x 10 reps of squats) \+ back extensions (2 x 20), engaging glutes |
| Week 2  | Rest. Heat ideal | 6-14 miles easy with 5 x 20 seconds fast/2 min easy. [On these flatter strides](https://www.trailrunnermag.com/training/trail-tips-training/why-and-how-to-run-strides-to-improve-speed-on-the-trails/), ease into them even more since injury risk is higher The top end of the range is only for high mileage athletes. Most athletes will thrive in the middle of the range\! | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 16 x 1 min fast/1 min easy (think 5k effort on fasts), 2-3 miles easy/mod to mod (think 50k), 1-2 miles easy. After workouts is the most ideal time for post-run uphill treadmill. Speed workout classic\! Just building up speed stimulus Optional easy double or x-train with heat suit Light Strength | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 5 x (4 x 1 min fast/1 min easy) with 2 min easy between sets. We want to build some x-train power before it becomes mostly aerobic later | 4-12 miles very easy Heat ideal. You can add passive heat on other days as well | 13-18 miles easy/mod (20 min mod/hard around 1-hour effort near the start of the run). On the tempo, think relaxed, with permission to push a bit more near the end\!  Strength \+ squats \+ back extensions. Strength a day earlier when Tuesday workouts the following week\! But you can be flexible with timing | 6-14 miles very easy plus 6 x 30 second hills fast or easy/mod x-train. The stress of the first 2 weeks likely adding up a bit now\!  |
| Week 3  | Rest. Heat ideal | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 2-3 x (4 x 2 min fast/1 min easy) with 2 min easy between sets (think 10k to 5k effort), 2 miles moderate (think marathon), 1-2 miles easy. Really big and hard session\! For the big workouts, there is a range of sets so that lower volume athletes don’t overdo it Optional easy double or x-train with heat suit | 6-14 miles easy plus 6 x 20 second hills fast No mid-week strength work | 1-2 hours easy x-train with 4 x 3/2/1 min fast with 1 min easy between intervals and 3 min easy between sets | 4-12 miles very easy Heat ideal | 16-20 miles easy with 1 mile harder near the end. Pure aerobic day, with the faster mile being a fatigue resistance stimulus | 8-14 miles easy or easy/mod x-train Strength \+ squats \+ back extensions |
| Week 4  | Rest. Heat ideal | 8-14 miles easy | Uphill treadmill at 8-10% ideal, though this workout can also be done outside\! 15-20 min easy warm-up, 12-15 x 3 min around 1-hour effort with 90 seconds easy recovery after each, 15-20 min easy cooldown. Uphill treadmill threshold workouts allow for very big sessions with little impact or risk, and will be key to this plan. If doing these workouts outside, err on the side of more relaxed\! Optional easy double or x-train with heat suit Light strength | 1-2 hours easy x-train. Make sure this is quality Z2\! | 6-14 miles very easy plus 5 x 20 second hills Heat ideal | 12-18 miles easy/mod with 20 min mod/hard around 1-hour effort, finishing harder near the start of the run, plus 5 min harder near the end. This run will tax glycogen reserves, so fuel with major focus\! | 10-16 miles easy plus 6 x 30 second hills at the end or easy/mod x-train Strength \+ squats \+ back extensions |
| Week 5  | Rest. Heat ideal | 8-14 miles easy with 5 x 20 seconds fast/2 min easy | 2-4 miles easy warm-up, 3-4 x 3/2/1 min fast with 1 min easy between intervals and 2 min easy between sets (think 10k to 5k effort), 2-3 miles steady (think 50k), 1-2 miles easy Optional easy double or x-train with heat suit Light strength | 1.5-2.5 hours easy x-train | 6-14 miles very easy Heat ideal | 16-20 miles easy/mod (1 hour mod to mod/hard, starting at marathon effort and progressing as you go). The power hour will be a bit tough, embrace that space since it will have the best translation to race readiness\! You can also do training races any week\! | 10-16 miles easy/mod on flatter terrain, progressing to steady running or easy/mod x-train. Steady running just means a light flow, nothing hard Strength \+ squats \+ back extensions |
| Week 6  | Rest. Heat ideal | 6-12 miles easy plus 5 x 20 second hills | 10-13 miles easy/mod to mod, progressing effort as you go, 2 miles easy cool-down.

| Week 9 | Rest. Heat ideal | 8-14 miles easy with 5 x 30 seconds fast/2 min easy. Dial back volume this week if you’re feeling beat up at all--we’re trying to have a slight overreach here for adaptation on the down week next week\! | 2-3 mi easy warm-up, 5-8 x 3 min fast (think 10k effort) with 2 min float recovery (just above normal easy), 2 mi steady, 1-2 mi easy.

Want to go into this 50k+ recovered and ready\! Heat ideal | 3-6 miles easy to steady plus 4 x 30 sec light hills around 3k/5k effort. Z2 running ideal for tune-up. HR will be jumpy and that’s ok\!  | BIG DAY\!\!\!\! This can be a marathon, 50k, or even 50 mile race. If no racing, aim for a **moderate 50k** on terrain like the race, pushing moderately hard and with full fueling approach. You can move this backward to 8-10 weeks pre-race if there’s a race or 100k, just move around weeks accordingly. Goal: get very sore\! | CELEBRATION\! You should be quite sore from this one in a good way |
| Week 11 | Rest. Heat ideal | Rest. This is a mid-cycle rest block, with a down week ahead to solidify gains Heat ideal | 4-10 miles easy. Really ease back in\! Now is when to start focused heat suit training if your race might be very hot.

No strength mid-week\! | 1-2 hours easy x-train | 6-14 miles easy plus 5 x 20 second hills Heat ideal | 16-22 mi easy/mod to moderate with harder eccentric muscle contractions on downhill. The goal is to get the final repeated bout effect benefit. Steep is good\! However, if you are feeling too tired, now is the time to dial back more and keep this run to 12 miles tops, starting the taper earlier | 10-16 mi easy, flowing to steady on flatter terrain or easy/mod x-train Strength \+ squats \+ back extensions.
